This project contains two responsive pricing table designs built using HTML and CSS.

The first layout features a simple flexbox-based pricing card UI with clean styling and hover effects.

The second layout includes an advanced modern pricing grid with icons, gradients, and improved visual hierarchy.

Both designs are fully responsive and adjust smoothly on smaller screens.

You can customize colors, pricing, features, and layout as needed.

Just open the HTML file in any browser to view the pricing tables.

Ideal for landing pages, subscription sections, and UI design practice.# web-d-assignment
